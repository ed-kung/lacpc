2018-11-29-8,"SUMMARY OF AGENDA ITEM may include some external information beyond a strict summary in ""The City Planning Commission is tasked with recommending actions to the City Council, including determining CEQA exemption status, approving the ordinance, adopting the staff report, and adopting the findings.""  SUMMARY OF CPC DELIBERATIONS: could struggle due to the style of the information layout in the document while  SUMMARY OF MOTION is a satisfying response."
2019-03-28-5c,"RELATED CASES: this is part of a consent calendar (Item 5), which are all lumped under one timem(5a,5b,5c). For related cases it doesn’t mention the case numbers of 5a or 5b. I would think that might have been easy to pick up on, although maybe we needed to give it more accurate instructions. SUMMARY OF CPC MOTION: I think it would have been able to noticed that 5a was exluded from the calendar and dicussed further, but since we asked about 5c, it makes sense to not include that, but I wonder if it could catch it for one that was in a calendar and then excluded.

2020-12-10-6,"Its usually noted if a meeting was over zoom, in this SUMMARY OF CPC DELIBERATIONS its not mentioned, although I assume that was common for pandemic years. Also a crucial part of the motion was ""Approve and recommend that the City Council determine, based on the whole of the administrative record, the Project is not a “project” as defined by CEQA Guidelines Section 15378;"" that wasnt inlcuded. The wording ""with modifications, if any"" is a part of the strucutre of minute meeting documents, not something we should use when summarizing the document. Also ""Approve and recommend that the City Council adopt the proposed ordinance as modified by the Commission;"" is missing in SUMMARY OF CPC MOTION. Overall a response that wasnt satisfactory. "

2022-05-26-6a,"Okay response. SUMMARY OF CPC DELIBERATIONS: just barely gets by, should really be talking about what is the proposed prohect and in the minutes document what does the CPC change or add to this proposal beyond indicating it was part of a consent calendar. When it says a consent calendar is non controversial, that is something always repeated in these kind of items so thats where you can see that the output it missing the point of what this proposal is and how it was changed during the motion. SUMMARY OF CPC MOTION is good enough but could have gone a little bit more in detail, explaining the changed that happen in the motion. "

2024-09-12-5c,"SUMMARY OF CPC DELIBERATION: Response talks about a presentation, which I can neither find on the documents nor think would be more important than explaining what the CPC did with this motion. Should moreso be about how, in this motion the CPC adopts all the requested actions that are laid out in the agenda. I feel thats the challenge of the output responses, is it struggles at times to link Agenda document to Minutes document, and the DELIBERATIONS SUMMARY struggles because of that. "
