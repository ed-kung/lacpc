ITEM NO. 8
ZA-2022-8997-ZAI-1A

RELATED CASES:
ZA-2022-8997-ZAI-1A

SUMMARY OF AGENDA ITEM:
The agenda item concerns a Zoning Administratorâ€™s Interpretation (ZAI) applicable to all oil and gas well operations in the City of Los Angeles. The interpretation defines "well maintenance" in the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) as activities that trigger a rework permit from the California Geologic Energy Management Division or require online notification per South Coast Air Quality Management District Rule 1148.2. The ZAI is not considered a "project" under CEQA guidelines, but it was evaluated in the Initial Study for the Oil and Gas Drilling Ordinance (Ordinance 187,709). Appeals were filed against this interpretation by several parties.

SUMMARY OF CPC DELIBERATIONS:
During the CPC meeting, representatives from the Planning Department and appellants were present. The discussion focused on the ZAI's interpretation of "well maintenance" and its implications. The CPC considered the appeals, which primarily addressed concerns related to the Oil and Gas Drilling Ordinance rather than the ZAI itself. The CPC noted that the ZAI does not establish new regulations but clarifies existing zoning terms.

SUMMARY OF CPC MOTION:
The motion proposed by Commission President Millman included granting the appeal in part, adopting a modified ZAI dated October 4, 2023, and affirming that the ZAI is not a "project" under CEQA guidelines. The motion also clarified the scope of the ZAI and the authority of the Zoning Administrator to interpret zoning regulations.

ALIGNMENT OF MOTION TO PROPOSAL:
The CPC voted to approve the agenda item with modifications, granting the appeal in part and adopting the modified ZAI.

VOTE TOTAL:
5-0
