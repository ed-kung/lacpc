SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Marie Hammond, a resident of Venice, expressing concerns about the Al Fresco dining ordinance. She argues that Al Fresco dining should not be allowed across alleys from residential (R) zoned properties unless there is a building acting as a buffer. She highlights the issue of increased dining areas leading to reduced parking availability for residents, particularly in the Coastal Zone where preferential parking is not allowed. While she does not oppose Al Fresco dining in front of restaurants, she is against its expansion into parking lots.
