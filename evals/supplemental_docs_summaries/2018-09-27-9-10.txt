SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:  
The document is a memorandum from Mark Friedlander, a Planning Assistant, to the City Planning Commission. It outlines technical modifications to the staff recommendation report for Case No. CPC-2018-3276-SN, which is related to the NoHo West Sign District. The modifications propose exempting three Supergraphic signs on the east elevation of Building H from the sign reduction requirements, allowing them to display non-commercial content as an amenity to a nearby school. This exemption aims to encourage the use of these signs for school programming or public service messaging without the disincentive of sign reduction requirements.
