SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The letter, written by Lynn Mohrfeld, President & CEO of the California Hotel & Lodging Association, expresses support for a proposed ordinance related to voluntary housing and conditional use permits. This ordinance is seen as a compromise to the "Homeless in Hotels" ballot measure proposed by Unite Here Local 11. The letter argues that the ordinance will protect hotel employees and guests by preventing hotels from being turned into temporary homeless shelters, which the ballot measure would have mandated. The author appreciates the efforts of the City Council, particularly Council President Krekorian, in finding a solution that balances the interests of hotel employees and the community.

REFERENCED AGENDA ITEMS:
None.
