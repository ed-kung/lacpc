SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a technical letter from Yorke Engineering, LLC, addressing comments made by the Supporters Alliance for Environmental Responsibility (SAFER) regarding their appeal of the Planning Directorâ€™s decision to exempt the Arapahoe Apartments Project from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) under the Infill Exemption. The letter argues against SAFER's claims of significant air quality impacts from diesel particulate matter and formaldehyde emissions. It provides a detailed analysis and corrections to SAFER's calculations, asserting that the project will not exceed air quality thresholds and that the concerns about indoor air quality impacts are not applicable under CEQA guidelines.
