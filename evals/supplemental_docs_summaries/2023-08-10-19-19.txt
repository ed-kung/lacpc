The author of the submitted document is an individual.

SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Steven Porch addressed to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission. It expresses opposition to the requested waivers for the proposed development at 12124 Pacific Avenue. The author argues that the waivers, which include a reduction in standard setbacks, an increase in Floor Area Ratio (FAR), and an increase in building height, are inappropriate for the area. The letter highlights concerns about reduced space and light, increased street parking pressure, traffic density, noise, and light pollution. The author believes these changes would alter the character of the low-rise neighborhood and do not address the city's real issues, such as affordable housing and pollution.
