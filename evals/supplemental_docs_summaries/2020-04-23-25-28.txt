SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter addressed to the Department of Planning, expressing concerns about the scheduling of an online hearing for a proposed real estate project at 1309 Pacific in San Pedro (CPC-2019-4908-DB-SPR) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The author argues that the hearing should be postponed due to limited public access to physical documents and case files, which are necessary for informed public comments. The letter highlights issues such as inadequate notice, discrimination against those without access to technology, and the potential for cumulative impacts with another nearby project. The author also raises concerns about the ethics of the developers and the potential for setting a precedent for future projects. The letter requests that the hearing be postponed until the public can access the case files and participate in person.
