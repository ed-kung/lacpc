SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a public comment submitted by Jay Ross on behalf of the West Los Angeles Sawtelle Neighborhood Council (WLASNC) regarding the proposed apartment project at 2465 S. Purdue Avenue. The letter outlines the WLASNC's decision not to support the project as designed, citing a vote against a resolution to support it. The letter mentions that the developer was unwilling to meet certain conditions proposed by the Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM) committee, such as adding a moderate-income unit and providing metro passes for new residents. The document also provides background information on the project, including the demolition of existing rent-stabilized units and the proposed building's height and design, which the WLASNC feels is out of character with the neighborhood.
