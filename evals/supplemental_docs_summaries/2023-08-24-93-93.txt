SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Gail and Paul Wunsch, Studio City stakeholders, expressing concerns about the Harvard-Westlake School redevelopment project. The letter argues that the project's scope is too large for the property and criticizes the removal of 240 mature trees, which provide a cooling canopy. It raises concerns about increased traffic, light, air, and noise pollution as indicated in the Environmental Impact Reports. The letter also questions the recreational equity of the project, suggesting that the facilities are redundant and not truly accessible to the public. Additionally, it mentions the presence of high walls around the site and urges the commission to ensure no PFAS chemicals are used in the turf fields.
