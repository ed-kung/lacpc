SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Casey Maddren expressing strong opposition to the application by Omninet for entitlements related to the Kipling Apartments at 4067-4085 West 3rd Street & 266-272 South Kingsley Drive. The letter argues that the conversion of 139 units to light housekeeping rooms undermines the protections offered by the Residential Hotel Ordinance and the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, which protect low-income renters. The author accuses Omninet of rebranding the property as a hotel and beginning the conversion process without proper approvals, urging the City Planning Commission to reject the application to prevent the loss of low-cost housing.
