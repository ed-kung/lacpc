SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Mitchell M. Tsai, an attorney representing the Coalition to Preserve LA, submitted to the Los Angeles City Planning Commission. The letter addresses concerns regarding Agenda Items Nos. 7 and 8, which pertain to the Sunset and Gordon Mixed Use Project. The letter argues that the Tentative Tract Map for the project fails to comply with the State Subdivision Map Act and is inconsistent with the City of Los Angeles General Plan and the Hollywood Community Plan. It highlights issues such as inadequate affordable housing provisions, significant traffic impacts, and the lack of a station area master plan. The letter also requests a stay on project approvals pending the completion of all administrative remedies, including an appeal to the City Council.
