SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The letter, written by Cynthia Fuller, expresses opposition to the proposed Montecito II project, which involves adding a new 6-story building to the existing historic Montecito building, a 10-story Art Deco tower. The author argues that the new construction would smother and destroy the historical and aesthetic value of the existing Historical Cultural Monument (HCM), making it appear cluttered and hidden. While acknowledging the need for affordable housing, the author urges the Cultural Heritage Commission to reject the project to preserve the unique character of the HCM.
