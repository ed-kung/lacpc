SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is an email from Jay Ross expressing concern about the affordable housing component of a proposed project at 3018 S. Western Avenue. The author argues that the project, which requests five large off-menu incentives and waivers, should have a higher affordable housing requirement, suggesting that 20% of the total units should be affordable. The current proposal includes 14 affordable units out of 114 total units, which the author deems insufficient.
