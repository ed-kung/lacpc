SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Michael Gonzales of Gonzales Law Group, APC, representing Roberto Valentino, LLC, regarding the Hollywood Community Plan Update. The letter expresses appreciation for the efforts of the Los Angeles Department of City Planning in updating the plan but raises concerns about the proposed Community Plan Implementation Overlay (CPIO) and its impact on the property located at 7038 – 7032 Sunset Boulevard and 1433 – 1445 Sycamore Avenue. The letter argues that the CPIO's current floor area ratio (FAR) restrictions for mixed-income projects are too limiting and could hinder housing development. It requests that the FAR be increased to 3.75 to 1 for mixed-income projects to better utilize the property's potential, given its proximity to transit options.
