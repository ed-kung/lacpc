SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:
The document is a letter from Mark Montiel expressing support for the proposed 95-unit graduate student housing development at 1630 N San Pablo St and 3660-3700 E Valley Blvd. The letter urges the City Planning Commission to approve the Zoning Administratorâ€™s Determination for shared parking, the Site Plan Review, and to adopt the previously certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and Addendums as CEQA compliance, along with the Mitigation Monitoring Program (MMP) for the project. The letter highlights the severe housing shortage in Los Angeles, particularly for college students, and argues that the project will help reduce student housing insecurity and gentrification. It also emphasizes the project's location benefits, such as proximity to public transportation and amenities.
