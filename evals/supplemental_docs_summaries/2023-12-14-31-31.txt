SUMMARY OF DOCUMENT:  
The document is a letter from Frances Offenhauser, on behalf of Hollywood Heritage, addressing concerns about the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the 1360 North Vine project. The letter highlights several issues, including errors in the FEIR responses, computation errors related to the Density Bonus Off Menu Waiver, procedural errors, and incorrect findings in the Case Staff Report. It also criticizes the evaluation of commercial uses in bungalows, suggests the removal of tennis courts, pool, and landscaping from the project, and points out undisclosed computations for the Office Option's density. Additionally, it argues that EIR Alternative #3 for residential use is superior.
