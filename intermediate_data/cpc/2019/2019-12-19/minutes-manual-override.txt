         An ordinance amending Sections 12.03, 12.22, and 19.01 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC)
         to regulate the use of non-primary residences for short term rentals as Vacation Rentals, and to
         establish related fees and fines.                                          
                                                                                    
         1. Approve and Recommend that the City Council determine, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section
            15074(b), after consideration of the whole of the administrative record, including the Negative
            Declaration, No. ENV-2019-7046-ND, and all comments received, there is no substantial
            evidence that the project will have a significant effect on the environment; find the Negative
            Declaration reflects the independent judgement and analysis of the City; adopt the Negative
            Declaration; and determine, based on the whole of the administrative record, that the Project is
            exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15301 (Class 1), and there is no
            substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a Categorical Exemption pursuant to
            CEQA Guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies;                               
                                                                                    
         2. Approve and Recommend, that the City Council adopt the proposed ordinance as modified by
            the City Planning Commission, as follows:                               
            •   Increase the citywide cap from 3,625 (the equivalent of 0.25 percent of the current housing
                supply) to the equivalent of 1 percent.                             
            •   Change the geographic unit subject to concentration caps from Census tracts to community
                plan areas, and increase the cap from 0.25 percent to 1 percent.    
            •   Increase the maximum number of days per calendar year a Vacation Rental may be rented
                from 30 to 90 days.                                                 
            •   Specify that the required 250 feet of separation between Vacation Rental units in Type 1
                buildings be per block face.                                        
                                                                                    
         3. Instructed City Planning to study and report to the Planning and Land Use Management (PLUM)
            Committee on the following:                                             
                                                                                    
            •   Feasibility of requiring documentation showing Vacation Rentals are second homes, not
                investment properties.                                              
            •   Feasibility of limiting Vacation Rental ownership eligibility to individuals and individual trusts,
                not limited liability corporations.                                 
            •   Feasibility of allocating a significant portion of the Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) and/or
                fees collected from Vacation Rentals to support affordable housing, permanent supportive
                housing, and/or housing for the homeless.                           
            •   Additional information regarding the economic tipping point between a long-term and short-
                term rental within the construct of other regulatory limitations of the ordinance.
                                                                                    
         4. Adopt the Staff Report as the Commission report on the subject, including Staff’s Technical
            Modification dated December 16, 2019; and                               
                                                                                    
         5. Adopt the Findings.
