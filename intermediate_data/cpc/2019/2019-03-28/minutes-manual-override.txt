            Commissioner Khorsand put forth the actions below in conjunction with the approval of the
            following project with modifications, if any, stated on the record:     
                                                                                    
            The construction, operation, and maintenance of a mixed-use building comprising 179 residential
            apartment units, including eight dwelling units reserved for Very Low Income Households, and
            approximately 5,684 square feet of commercial floor area, with a maximum height of
            approximately 60 feet (exclusive of roof projections), varying from two to five stories on a 67,315-
            square foot portion of the site, and a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 2.40:1. Off-street parking will be
            provided at grade and within two subterranean levels for a total of 263 parking spaces. The
            project provides 19,336 square feet of open space. The site is currently developed with an
            approximately 62,562 square-foot, seven-story Adaptive Re-Use building in the northeast portion
            of the project site. Combined, the Adaptive Re-use Building and new construction will result in
            234 apartment units and 14,184 square feet of commercial floor area on the site. A total of 263
            automobile parking spaces are required and provided onsite for both the Adaptive Re-Use and
            new construction, and 237 bicycle parking spaces are proposed across both parts of the project
            site.                                                                   
            1.   Find, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15074(b), after consideration of the whole of
                 the administrative record, including the Mitigated Negative Declaration, No. ENV-2016-
                 3904-MND (“Mitigated Negative Declaration”), and all comments received, with the
                 imposition of mitigation measures, there is no substantial evidence that the project will
                 have a significant effect on the environment; Find the Mitigated Negative Declaration
                 reflects the independent judgment and analysis of the City; Find the mitigation measures
                 have been made enforceable conditions on the project; and Adopt the Mitigated Negative
                 Declaration and the Mitigation Monitoring Program prepared for the Mitigated Negative
                 Declaration;                                                       
            2.   Approve, pursuant to Section 12.32 Q of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), a

                 for Very Low Income Households, with one On-Menu Incentive for an increase in height
                 to 60 feet in lieu of the 50-foot height limitation;               
            4.   Approve, pursuant to LAMC Section 16.05, a Site Plan Review for a project that results
                 in an increase of 50 or more dwelling units;                       
            5.   Adopt the Conditions of Approval, as modified by the Commission, including Staff’s
                 Technical Modification dated March 27, 2019; and                   
            6.   Adopt the Findings, as amended by Staff’s Technical Modification dated March 27, 2019.
