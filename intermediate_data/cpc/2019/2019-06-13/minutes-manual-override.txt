            MOTION:                                                                 
            Commissioner Perlman put forth the actions below in conjunction with the approval of the
            following Project with modifications, if any, stated on the record:     
                                                                                    
            The Project proposes to develop a mixed-use project (Project) on a 141,987-square-foot site
            (3.26 acres) located within the Central City Community Plan area of the City of Los Angeles
            (City). The Project includes three high-rise towers (65-story ‘Tower A’; 43-story ‘Tower B’; and
            53-story ‘Tower C’), including a four-story podium connecting all three towers. The Project would
            provide up to approximately 163,015 square feet of open space and recreational amenities.
            Overall, the new building would comprise up to 1,845,831 square feet of floor area. A Sign District
            is proposed for the Project Site. The tallest tower, Tower A, would have a maximum height of
            853 feet above ground level. Tower A would include up to 1,000 hotel rooms and up to 19,952
            square feet of restaurant/retail uses. Tower B would include up to 363 residential units and up to
            11,769 square feet of restaurant/retail uses. Tower C would include up to 516 residential units
            and up to 8,279 square feet of restaurant/retail uses. The proposed uses would be supported by
            up to 2,131 parking spaces and 1,173 bicycle parking spaces located in five subterranean levels
            and four above ground parking levels. To accommodate the Project, the existing 43,892 square-
            foot medical office and urgent care facility, and associated surface parking lot area would be
            removed.                                                                
                                                                                    
            1.  Find, based on the independent judgment of the decision-maker, after consideration of the
                whole of the administrative record, the Project was assessed in the Olympia Project EIR,
                No. Report ENV-2016-4889-EIR, SCH No. 2017101008, previously certified on January
                29, 2019; and pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Sections 15162 and 15164, no subsequent
                EIR, negative declaration or addendum is required for approval of the Project;
