         Proposed Ordinance is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to

         pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2 applies;                       
       2. Approve and Recommend that the City Council adopt the Proposed Ordinance;

       Termination of the Development Agreement (DA) contract, by and between the City of Los Angeles and
       TrizecHahn Hollywood, LLC, executed November 5, 2002. A Notice of Default was issued on February
       22, 2024, and the purported successor Developer was required to cure the default by April 22, 2024. As
       the purported successor Developer has not cured the default, the Director of Planning is utilizing the
       Failure to Cure Default Procedures of Section 5.1.3 of the DA for the City Planning Commission to
       terminate the DA contract. Termination of the DA contract shall not affect the previously approved Zone
       Variance entitlement pertaining to location of employee parking spaces.      
                                                                                    
       1. Determine, that based on the whole of the administrative record, the termination of the DA contract in
         accordance with the terms of the DA is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section
         15321 (Class 21), and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that any exceptions contained
         in Section 15300.2 of the State CEQA Guidelines regarding location, cumulative impacts, significant
         effects or unusual circumstances, scenic highways, or hazardous waste sites, or historical resources
         applies;                                                                   
       2. Find and determine, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the purported successor Developer has
         not cured a default pursuant to Section 5.1 of the Development Agreement (DA) contract;
       3. Terminated the Development Agreement (DA) contract, pursuant to California Government Code
         Section 65867 and 65868 and Section 5.1.3. of the DA (Ordinance 174,843); and
       4. Adopt the Findings.

       MOTION:                                                                      
       Commission President Lawshe moved to put forth the actions below in conjunction with the following
       Project, as stated on the record:                                            
                                                                                    
       Demolition of an existing grocery store, recycling center, and surface parking lot for the construction of a

       Households. The proposed project will contain an approximate total of 89,719 square-feet of floor area,
       resulting in a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 3.32:1, and will rise to a maximum height of 79 feet.

          19, Section 15332 (Urban Infill Development), and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating
          that an exception to a categorical exemption pursuant to State CEQA Statute and Guidelines, Section
          15300.2 applies;                                                          
       2. Deny the appeals and sustain the Director of Planning determination dated December 6, 2023;

          for a period of 55 years, with Base Incentives permitted pursuant to LAMC Section 12.21 A.31, along

            57 feet permitted under LAMC 12.21.1;                                   
          b. Open Space. A 25-percent reduction in Open Space to allow 9,413 square-feet in lieu of the

          c. Yards/Setbacks. Utilization of RAS3 yards/setbacks as allowed for an applicable TOC project in
            a commercial zone:                                                      
            •  Easterly Side Yard. Provide a minimum side yard setback of five feet;
