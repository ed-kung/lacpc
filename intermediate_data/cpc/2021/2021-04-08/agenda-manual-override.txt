            PROJECT SITE:  2117 – 2147 East Violet Street; 2118 – 2142 East 7th Place
                                                                                    
            PROPOSED PROJECT:                                                       
            The Project would include up to 347 new live-work units, approximately 187,374 square feet of
            new office space, 21,858 square feet of new commercial uses, and a 926 square-foot community
            room on a 96,523-square-foot (2.2-acre) Site (Project Site). Of the 347 new live-work units, in
            compliance with Measure JJJ, five percent of the total proposed rental units (up to 18 units) would
            be set aside for Extremely Low-Income Households and 11 percent of the total proposed rental
            units (up to 39 units) would be set aside for Very Low-Income Households. If the new residential
            units are provided for-sale, then instead, 11 percent of the total proposed for-sale units (up to 39
            units) would be set aside for Very Low Income Households. If both rental and for-sale units are
            provided, the Project shall comply with the applicable rental and for-sale provisions. The uses
            would be located in a 36-story residential tower with a maximum height of 425 feet and an eight-
            story office building with a maximum height of 131 feet. In addition, five existing buildings located
            on the northern portion of the Project Site, that comprise approximately 56,686 square feet, would
            be retained with six currently vacant live-work units, office, retail, restaurant, and warehouse uses.
            Two additional existing buildings that comprise approximately 6,844 square feet and contain four
            vacant live-work units, as well as two open sheds, and surface parking areas located on the
            southern portion of the Site, would all be demolished. Upon completion, the Project’s total floor
            area would be 569,448 square feet, with a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 6:1.

       relay service (TRS) communications.                                          
                                                                                    
       Telecommunications Relay Service is a telephone service that allows persons with hearing or speech disabilities to
       place and receive telephone calls. TRS is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the
       U.S. territories for local and/or long distance calls. TRS providers - generally telephone companies - are
       compensated for the costs of providing TRS from either a state or a federal fund. There is no cost to the TRS user.
       What forms of TRS are available? There are several forms of TRS, depending on the particular needs of the user
       and the equipment available: TRS includes: Text to Voice TIY-Based TRS; Speech-to-Speech Relay Service; Shared
       Non-English Language Relay Service; Captioned Telephone Relay Service; Internet Protocol Relay Service; and
       Video    Relay   Service.   Please   visit   this   site    for    detail

       Don't hang up! Some people hang up on TRS calls because they think the CA is a telemarketer. If you hear, "Hello.
       This is the relay service..." when you pick up the phone, please don't hang up! You are about to talk, through a TRS
       provider, to a person who is deaf, hard-of-hearing, or has a speech disability.
