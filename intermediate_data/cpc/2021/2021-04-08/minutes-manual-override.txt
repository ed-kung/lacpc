       The Project would include up to 347 new live-work units, approximately 187,374 square feet of new office
       space, 21,858 square feet of new commercial uses, and a 926 square-foot community room on a 96,523-

       five percent of the total proposed rental units (up to 18 units) would be set aside for Extremely Low-Income
       Households and 11 percent of the total proposed rental units (up to 39 units) would be set aside for Very
       Low-Income Households. If the new residential units are provided for-sale, then instead, 11 percent of the
       total proposed for-sale units (up to 39 units) would be set aside for Very Low Income Households. If both
       rental and for-sale units are provided, the Project shall comply with the applicable rental and for-sale
       provisions. The uses would be located in a 36-story residential tower with a maximum height of 425 feet

       work units, as well as two open sheds, and surface parking areas located on the southern portion of the
       Site, would all be demolished. Upon completion, the Project’s total floor area would be 569,448 square
       feet, with a maximum floor area ratio (FAR) of 6:1.
