                              Telecommunication Relay Services                      
       Telephone communication is one of the most important forms of communication in society today. Due to
       advancements in technology, telephone devices have evolved with new services and capabilities. Individuals who
       are deaf and hard of hearing, and individuals with a speech disability are following these trends and are rapidly
       migrating to more advanced telecommunications methods, both for peer-to-peer and third-party telecommunications
       relay service (TRS) communications.                                          
                                                                                    
       Telecommunications Relay Service is a telephone service that allows persons with hearing or speech disabilities to
       place and receive telephone calls. TRS is available in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the

       U.S. territories for local and/or long distance calls. TRS providers - generally telephone companies - are
       compensated for the costs of providing TRS from either a state or a federal fund. There is no cost to the TRS user.
                                                                                    
       What forms of TRS are available? There are several forms of TRS, depending on the particular needs of the user
       and the equipment available: TRS includes: Text to Voice TIY-Based TRS; Speech-to-Speech Relay Service; Shared
       Non-English Language Relay Service; Captioned Telephone Relay Service; Internet Protocol Relay Service; and
       Video    Relay   Service.   Please   visit   this   site    for    detail    
       descriptions, https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/telecommunications-relay-service-trs.
       Don't hang up! Some people hang up on TRS calls because they think the CA is a telemarketer. If you hear, "Hello.
       This is the relay service..." when you pick up the phone, please don't hang up! You are about to talk, through a TRS
       provider, to a person who is deaf, hard-of-hearing, or has a speech disability.
