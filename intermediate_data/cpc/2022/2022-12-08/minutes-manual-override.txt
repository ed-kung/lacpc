       Code (LAMC) to create a new “Wildlife District,” or “WLD” Supplemental Use District. The proposed
       Wildlife District Ordinance (Ordinance) aims to reduce cumulative development impacts on plants, animals
       and natural resources while providing co-benefits related to climate resilience and public health. The
       Ordinance proposes development standards for lot coverage, floor area, grading and height limitations

       Ordinance includes regulations that apply to private properties within the District, including additional
       discretionary review where lots contain/adjacent to natural resources, such as waterways and open space.
       The Ordinance details regulations and procedures for project review and includes a map identifying lots
       subject to natural resource provisions.

         demonstrating that an exception to a Categorical Exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section
         15300.2 applies;                                                           
       2. Approve and Recommend that the City Council adopt the Proposed Ordinance to amend Sections
