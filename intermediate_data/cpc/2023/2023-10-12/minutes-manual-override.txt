       Construction, use, and maintenance of a new, six-story, 19,384 square-foot residential building with 17
       dwelling units, including two dwelling units set aside for affordable housing (or 10 percent of the proposed

       five residential levels above one ground floor level of residential lobby and parking and one subterranean
       level of parking. The Project will provide a total of 14 automobile parking spaces, and 17 long-term and
       two short-term bicycle parking spaces.

          b. Setbacks (Rear Yard). To permit up to a 30 percent decrease in the required width or depth of
            the rear yard; and                                                      
          c. Height. To permit an increase in height of two additional stories up to 22 additional feet;
       4. Adopt the Conditions of Approval; and                                     
       5. Adopt the Findings.

level of parking. The Project will provide a total of 14 automobile parking spaces, and 17 long-term and
