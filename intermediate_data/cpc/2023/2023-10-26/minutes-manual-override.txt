       MOTION:                                                                      
       Commissioner Choe moved to put forth the actions below in conjunction with approval of the following
       Specific Plan Amendment, as stated on the record:                            
                                                                                    
       An amendment to the Ventura-Cahuenga Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan pursuant to Sections 11.5.7 G
       and 12.32, of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), to create an administrative process for signage
       review, update the Plan to align with the Processes and Procedures Ordinance and the Mobility Element,
       amend the Specific Plan’s Plan Review Board appointments and administration, update references to
       corrected maps, and clean-up typos and plan language as well as code references.
                                                                                    
       1. Determine, based on the whole of the administrative record, that the Project is exempt from the
         California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Case No. ENV-2023-1638-CE (Exhibit C)
         and CEQA Guidelines, Section 15301 (Class 1 for existing structures, including interior alterations for
         tenant improvements); Section 15303 (Class 3 as applied to small structures for limited changes of
         use and interior alterations related to tenant improvements); Section 15311 (Class 11 for on-premises
         signs); and Section 15320 (Class 20 for changes in reorganization of local governmental agencies
         relating to the Ventura-Cahuenga Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan Review Board (PRB) appointments
         and administration, administrative project review process, updated language to reflect new ordinances
         and language clean up, recognition of a sixth community, and updated maps). There is no substantial
         evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines,
         Section 15300.2 applies;                                                   
       2. Approve and Recommend that the City Council adopt, pursuant to Sections 11.5.7 G and 12.32 of the
         Los Angeles Municipal Code, the linked proposed zoning ordinance to amend the Ventura-Cahuenga
         Boulevard Corridor Specific Plan, as shown in Exhibit B, with a modification to Section 15.A.5 of the
         Specific Plan as follows (specific language is detailed in Attachment 1):  
         a. Add the neighborhood councils to those listed to receive written notification of a Plan Review Board
            member’s term expiration prior to the end of the member’s term.         
       3. Adopt the Staff Report as the Commission’s Report on the subject; and     
       4. Adopt the Findings.

       Commissioner Choe moved to put forth the actions below in conjunction with approval of the following, as
       stated on the record:                                                        
                                                                                    
       A proposed ordinance, known as the Redevelopment Plan Procedures Reinstatement Ordinance,
       amending the Processes and Procedures Ordinance (Ordinance No. 187,712) to reinstate Section 11.5.14
       (Redevelopment Plan Procedures) in Chapter 1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), remove
       references to the North Hollywood and Chinatown Redevelopment Plans that have expired, and make
       minor technical modifications. The Processes and Procedures Ordinance, adopted in 2022, amended
       Chapter 1 of the LAMC and established Chapter 1A of the LAMC to reorganize the administrative
       processes and procedures relative to zoning and land use entitlements. As part of this comprehensive
       update, Section 11.5.14 (Redevelopment Plan Procedures) was inadvertently removed from Chapter 1 of
       the LAMC. The proposed ordinance is a technical and administrative correction to reinstate and make
       technical modifications to Section 11.5.14 in Chapter 1 of LAMC and does not propose any policy changes.
                                                                                    
       1. Recommend that the City Council determine, based on the whole of the administrative record, that the
         proposed ordinance is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15061(b)(3) and
         Section 15378(b)(5), and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a
         Categorical Exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15300.2 applies;
       2. Approve and Recommend that the City Council adopt the proposed ordinance; 
       3. Recommended that the City Council instruct the City Attorney that the proposed ordinance be
         incorporated into Chapter 1A of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (new Zoning Code), subject to
         changes to conform to the format and style of the new Zoning Code;         
       4. Recommend that the City Council instruct that the proposed ordinance be incorporated into Chapter
         1A of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (new Zoning Code), subject to changes to conform to the format
         and style of the new Zoning Code;                                          
       5. Adopt the Staff Recommendation Report as the Commission’s Report on the subject; and
       6. Adopt the Findings, including Staff’s Technical Modification dated October 25, 2023.
