       MOTION:                                                                      
       Commissioner Zamora moved to put forth the actions below in conjunction with approval of the following
       Project, with Modifications and Amendments, as stated on the record:         
                                                                                    
       Redevelopment of a 16.1-acre site and adjacent 1.1-acre portion of property along the LA River, totaling
       17.2-acres (749,344 square feet) (Project Site), for use as an athletic and recreational facility for the
       Harvard-Westlake School and shared public use. The Project removes the existing golf course, driving
       range, and tennis facility, to develop two athletic fields with bleacher seating, an 80,249 square feet, two-
       story gymnasium with a maximum height of 30 feet, a 52-meter swimming pool with seating, eight tennis
       courts with seating, one level of below-grade parking and a surface parking lot. The Project includes
       ancillary field buildings, three security kiosks, exterior light poles, walls/fencing, and retention of the
       existing clubhouse structure, putting green, low brick retaining wall with weeping mortar, and golf ball-
       shaped light standards. The Project removes 215 existing trees and plants 368 new trees, includes a
       350,000-gallon stormwater capture and reuse system, provides 5.4 acres (235,224 square feet) of publicly
       accessible open space and landscaped pathways connecting to the adjacent Zev Greenway, and provides
       on-site landscaped areas and recreational facilities. The Project involves off-site improvements to the
       Valleyheart Drive public right-of-way and portions of the adjacent Zev Greenway. Project development
       requires excavation and grading to a maximum depth of 21 feet below grade and a net cut/fill volume of
       197,000 cubic yards.

       Commissioner Noonan moved to put forth the actions below in conjunction with approval of the following
       Project, as stated on the record:                                            
                                                                                    
       Construction of a seven-story, 79-foot-tall mixed-use residential apartment building with 47 dwelling units
       (including five Very Low Income units). The Project will be approximately 51,052 square feet in floor area
       including 2,627 square feet of restaurant space with a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 4.4:1. The Project will
       provide 38 parking spaces in a partial at-grade and subterranean parking level. The site is currently
       improved with a one-story commercial building which will be demolished. No protected trees will be
       removed from the subject site; two non-protected street trees will remain along the public right-of-way and
       two non-protected street trees will be removed. The Project will also require a haul route for the export of
       approximately 6,081 cubic yards of soil.                                     
       1. Find, based on the independent judgment of the decision-maker, after consideration of the whole of
          the administrative record, that the project is within the scope of the Exposition Corridor Transit
          Neighborhood Plan Program EIR No. ENV-2013-622-EIR, SCH. No 2013031038 (“Program EIR”),
          pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15168 and 15162; the environmental effects of the Project
          were covered in the Program EIR and no new environmental effects not identified in the Program EIR
          will occur and no new mitigation is required; and the City has incorporated all feasible mitigation
          measures from the Program EIR on the Project;                             
       2. Determine, based on the whole of the record, that the project is Statutorily Exempt pursuant to Public
          Resources Code Section 21155.4 and the events specified in Section 21166 have not occurred;
       3. Approve, pursuant to Section 12.22 A.25(g)(3) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), a Density
          Bonus/Affordable Housing Incentive Program Compliance Review to permit the construction of a
          Housing Development Project totaling 47 units, reserving five units for Very Low Income Household
          occupancy for a period of 55 years, with the following Off-Menu Incentives and the following Waivers
          of Development Standards:

       Project, as stated on the record:                                            
                                                                                    
       Construction of a five-story, 65-foot tall residential apartment building with 30 dwelling units (including four
       Very Low Income units). The Project will be approximately 22,375 square feet in floor area with a Floor
       Area Ratio (FAR) of 2.7:1. The Project will provide 16 parking spaces at grade. The site is currently
       improved with a one-story commercial building, which will be demolished. No protected trees will be
       removed from the subject site or adjacent public right-of-way; three existing non-protected street trees will
       remain along the public right-of-way. The Project will export approximately 900 cubic yards of soil.
       1. Determine, that based on the whole of the administrative record, the project is exempt from CEQA
          pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Article 19, Section 15332, Class 32, and that there is no substantial
          evidence demonstrating that an exception to a categorical exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines,
          Section 15300.2 applies;

          the administrative record, that the Project is within the scope of the Exposition Corridor Transit
          Neighborhood Plan Program EIR No. ENV-2013-622-EIR, SCH. No. 2013031038 (“Program EIR”),
          pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15168 and 15162; the environmental effects of the Project
          were covered in the Program EIR and no new environmental effects not identified in the Program EIR
          will occur and no new mitigation is required; and the City has incorporated all feasible mitigation
          measures from the Program EIR on the Project;                             
       3. Approve, pursuant to LAMC Section 12.22 A.25(g)(2) and (3), a Density Bonus/Affordable Housing
          Incentive Program Compliance Review to permit the construction of a Housing Development Project
          totaling 30 units, reserving four units for Very Low Income Household occupancy for a period of 55
          years, with the following On- and Off-Menu Incentives and Waivers of Development Standards:

          b. An On-Menu Incentive for a 20 percent reduction in the required open space, to allow 2,445
            square feet in lieu of the 3,050 square feet otherwise required by LAMC Section 12.21 G;
          c. An Off-Menu Incentive for a height increase to 65 feet in lieu of the 45 feet otherwise allowed by
            Expo TNP Section 2.4.1 and Table G;                                     
          d. A Waiver of Development Standards for the elimination of the transitional height requirements of
            LAMC Section 12.21.1.A.10; and                                          
          e. A Waiver of Development Standards for ground floor screening of zero feet in lieu of 25 feet for a
            portion of the frontage for parking and loading areas along Veteran Avenue otherwise required
            by Expo TNP Section 4.2.5.C.1;

          15332, Class 32, and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that an exception to a

          Impact Report), pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15168 and 15162; the environmental effects
          of the Project were covered in the Program EIR and no new environmental effects not identified in
          the Program EIR will occur and no new mitigation is required; and the City has incorporated all
          feasible mitigation measures from the Program EIR on the Project;         
       3. Deny the appeals and sustain the Planning Director’s Determination dated June 16, 2023;
