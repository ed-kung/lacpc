       project, as stated on the record:                                            
                                                                                    
       Partial maintenance and partial demolition of an existing multi-family residential complex for the
       construction of a new eight-story multi-family residential building with 108 new residential units, resulting
       in a total of 152 units (equal to a net increase of 80 units). 16 units will be set aside for Very Low Income
       households and two units will be set aside for Low Income households. The Project will provide a total of
       99 vehicle parking spaces.

          Assessment, No. ENV-2023-1540-SCEA (“SCEA”), and all comments received, after imposition of all
          mitigation measures there is no substantial evidence that the Project will have a significant effect on
          the environment; Find the project is a “transit priority project” as defined by PRC Section 21155 and
          the project has incorporated all feasible mitigation measures, performance standards, or criteria set
          forth in prior EIR(s), including SCAG 2020-2045 RTP/SCS EIR Schedule No. 20199011061; Found
          all potentially significant effects required to be identified in the initial study have been identified and
          analyzed in the SCEA; Find with respect to each significant effect on the environment required to be
          identified in the initial study for the SCEA, changes or alterations have been required in or
          incorporated into the project that avoid or mitigate the significant effects to a level of insignificance or
          those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency
          and have been, or can and should be, adopted by that other agency; Find the SCEA reflects the
          independent judgment and analysis of the City; Find the mitigation measures have been made
          enforceable conditions on the project; and Adopt the SCEA and the Mitigation Monitoring and
          Reporting Program prepared for the SCEA;

       MOTION:                                                                      
       Commission President Millman moved to put forth the actions below in conjunction with approval of the
       following project, with Modifications, as stated on the record:              
                                                                                    
       The Proposed Project is an update of the Cornfield Arroyo Seco Specific Plan (CASP). The Proposed
       Project replaces the existing CASP (Existing CASP) with a new Specific Plan (Proposed CASP) that
       includes revised zoning regulations, incentives, and boundaries, for the purpose of encouraging
       affordable, mixed-income, and permanent supportive housing production. The Proposed Project
       strengthens the CASP’s affordable housing requirements, including the recalibration of the CASP’s current
       incentive zoning system; establishes a new Community Benefits Program that incentivizes new publicly-
       accessible open space and community facilities; includes provisions that facilitate the production of new
       100 percent affordable housing and permanent supportive housing on public land; increases the zoning
       capacity for housing in targeted areas; and adopts a modernized zoning system based on the City’s New
       Zoning Code. Adoption of the Proposed Project will involve amendments to the General Plan (Downtown
       Community Plan Map, Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan Map, and Framework Element) and a
       number of implementing ordinances, including ordinances to amend the Zoning Map, repeal the Existing
       CASP and establish the Proposed CASP, add new zoning provisions to Chapter 1A of the New Zoning
       Code, amend the Cypress Park and Glassell Park Community Design Overlay (CDO) boundaries, and
       rescind the CASP Transfer of Floor Area (TFAR) Floor Area Payment Trust Fund.
                                                                                    
       1. Find that the City Planning Commission has reviewed and considered the Draft Environmental Impact

         in Exhibit C5;                                                             
       2. Direct staff to prepare a Final Environmental Impact Report, EIR findings, a Statement of Overriding
         Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring Program (MMP) for City Council consideration;
       3. Recommend the City Council adopt the Resolution in Exhibit C to certify a Final EIR, adopt EIR findings
         and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and adopt a Mitigation Monitoring Program;
       4. Approve and recommend that the Mayor approve and the City Council adopt, pursuant to Sec.
         13B.1.1. (General Plan Adoption/Amendment) of Chapter 1A of the Los Angeles Municipal Code
         (LAMC) and City Charter Section 555, the attached Resolution in Exhibit C to Amend the General Plan
