\subsection{Data Extraction with LLMs}

Extracting data from the raw PDFs downloaded from the Planning Department website is a multi-step process. First, individual agenda items need to be extracted from the raw agenda PDF. This is difficult using traditional NLP methods because the boundaries between agenda items in the PDF are not always consistently demarcated. However, LLMs are quite suited to this task of identifying the unique agenda items out of a single PDF containing the agenda.

The first step, therefore, is to extract the individual agenda items. Figure \ref{fig_split_agenda_prompt} shows the prompt we used to have the LLM read the agenda, then extract each individual agenda item. We ask the LLM to return the agenda's item number, its title (which is a Planning Department case number for any items requiring a decision), and a short summary of the agenda item.

After the agenda items are extracted, the next step is to extract data about each agenda item, using the agenda text. The raw agenda PDF is split into its individual components based on the extracted item number and title for each agenda item. The text for each individual agenda item is then fed into the prompt shown in Figure \ref{fig_agenda_items_prompt}.
