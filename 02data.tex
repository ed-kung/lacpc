\subsection{Institutional Background}

The Los Angeles planning and approvals process for urban development is a multi-layered process that requires the input of multiple agencies. 

\subsection{Data Acquisition}

The Planning Department's website maintains robust public documentation of City Planning Commission Meetings. For each meeting, the agenda, minutes, and any supplemental documents relevant to the meeting (letters from the public, traffic assessments, architectural reports, etc.) are available for download as PDF files.\footnote{As of August 26th, 2025, these documents are available at the URL: \url{https://planning.lacity.gov/about/commissions-boards-hearings}.} We downloaded these documents for all City Planning Commission meetings from May 10th, 2018 to December 19th, 2024. This resulted in documentary data for \gn{NumberOfMeetings} meetings, covering \gn{NumberOfAgendaItems} agenda items, with \gn{NumberOfSupplementalDocs} supplemental documents, spanning \gn{PageCount} pages of text.
