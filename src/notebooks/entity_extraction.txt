-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: {entity_types}
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)
 
3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.
 
4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>

SEC. 12.30. BOUNDARIES OF ZONES.
 
   A.   Purpose. It is intended that zone and height district boundaries coincide with street, alley, or lot lines, unless otherwise shown on the zoning map. However, under certain conditions, zone boundaries do not precisely coincide with street, alley, or lot lines and in those cases, the Director shall make adjustments pursuant to this section. Boundary adjustments are normally requested in contemplation of more extensive development of the property involved. In connection with those plans, standard street dedication is essential. Therefore, the following procedure is necessary to be established so that standard dedication and improvement of streets and alleys abutting the subject property may be required, where reasonable, as a prerequisite to the approval of the zone boundary adjustment.
 
   B.   Street, Alley or Lot Lines. The zone boundaries shall be either street, alley or lot lines unless otherwise shown on the zoning map, and where the indicated boundaries on the zoning map are approximately street, alley or lot lines, the street, alley or lot lines shall be construed to be the boundaries of those zones.
 
   C.   Scale on Map. Where the zone boundary lines are not approximately street alley or lot lines, or where property indicated on the zoning map is acreage and not subdivided into lots and blocks, the zone boundary lines on the zoning map shall be determined by the scale contained on the map.
 
   D.   Symbol for Zone. Where one symbol is used on the zoning map to indicate the zone classification of an area divided by an alley or alleys, that symbol shall establish the classification of the whole of that area.

Text:
Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.
