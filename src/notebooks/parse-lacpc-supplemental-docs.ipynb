      "For this developer, it’s been a long journey (PR nightmare?) getting this project permitted. Sadly, that's their bad luck as the\n",
      "first project introducing our community to an abrupt height shift from 1950s-era low-rise R1 to next-generation by-right\n",
      "density bonus buildings (7-8 stories) in the downtown Westchester area.\n",
      "Any developer introducing the first example of this change is going to get hammered by community fear and emotion.\n",
      "Which is why—in my experience—most for-profit developers do everything they can to avoid a community conversation in\n",
      "these 'new format debut' circumstances.\n",
      "CityView did quite the opposite, and that impresses me.\n",
      "PROJECT SUPPORT SPECIFICS\n",
      "I’ve lived off of La Tijera for almost 20 years and, after multiple public presentations and NC PLUC meetings reviewing the\n",
      "project, I am convinced this building is going to be an asset for our community, for several reasons:\n",
      "1. The development of a % of new affordable units in an area rich with transit. That’s a major win for our community.\n",
      "2. The developer’s willingness to listen to the community and make substantive changes to the plan in response. This is\n",
      "VERY unusual based on my experience working with for-profit developers while I sat on our local NC Planning and\n",
      "Land Use Committee, and after.\n",
      "3. The design of the building: I appreciate its architecture, the interesting facade, the care taken with screening above-\n",
      "ground levels of parking, etc. This is not a cheap, hit-and-run developer project.\n",
      "4. PUBLIC open space: it is very sensitive for a by-right project from a for-profit developer to dedicate some of the\n",
      "project’s open space to creating a public plaza adjacent to our beloved 1950s shopping area known as “The Triangle.”\n",
      "It is a thoughtful, generous gesture that is (again) VERY unusual.\n",
      "5. Builder will operate: the community gets a better building (both in design and contextual functionality) when the\n",
      "company building the project also intends to operate it. Developers who build-to-flip tend to deliver barely-acceptable\n",
