Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a Zoning Administrator may approve the use of any property in an \"A\" or \"R\" Zone for the erection and maintenance of temporary unlighted subdivision directional signs, which are neither reflective nor fluorescent, if the Zoning Administrator finds that the location of the signs is proper in relation to uses of adjacent property and that the use will not be materially detrimental to the property of other persons located in that vicinity. This approval shall be subject to the following regulations:\n",
      "            (1) An application shall be filed in the Office of Zoning Administration upon a form and accompanied by the data and information as has been prescribed by the Office. Each application shall be consented to and acknowledged by the owner or lessee of each parcel of property upon which a sign is to erected. Only one application need be filed for all temporary, unlighted, subdivision directional signs relating to a single subdivision separately numbered and recorded by the Los Angeles County Recorder. The manner of installation and conditions regulating number, size and type of signs shall be determined and approved by a Zoning Administrator. To the extent possible, the Zoning Administrator shall make available a list or explanation of those installation features and conditions that are usually required.\n",
      "            (2) An approval to erect and maintain signs pursuant to this paragraph shall be valid for one year. If, after one year, 3/4 of the dwelling units or lots have not been sold or leased for the first time, approval for retaining the directional signs for not more than an additional one-year period may be granted by a Zoning Administrator.\n",
      "            (3) No sign erected pursuant to this paragraph shall exceed 12 square feet in area.\n",
      "            (4) One temporary, unlighted, subdivision directional sign may be approved for location adjacent to each street which constitutes a separate and distinct direction on the route from a major or secondary highway to a subdivision site. Where there are two or more major or secondary highways from which there are routes to a subdivision site, signs may be approved only along two routes.\n",
      "            (5) The erection and maintenance of temporary, unlighted, subdivision directional signs may be approved only on vacant property; however, if a Zoning Administrator determines that vacant property is not available in locations where provisions for travel directions are essential, the Zoning Administrator may approve developed property for the location of signs.\n",
