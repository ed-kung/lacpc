\section{Methodology}\label{sec_methodology}

We model the CPC hearings as having three possible outcomes:
\begin{enumerate}[start=0]
\item The project is denied or the decision is postponed
\item The project is approved in part or with conditions or modifications
\item The project is approved
\end{enumerate}
Each project proposal $i$ is assumed to have a latent quality variable $y_i^\ast$ which determines the likelihood of the three outcomes. $y_i^\ast$ is modeled as a linear function of its observed project characteristics and bureaucratic factors, plus an error term:
\begin{align}
y_i^\ast = \mathbf{X}_i \beta + \epsilon_i
\end{align}
The latent quality of the project proposal determines its outcome at the CPC hearing. Let $y_{i} \in \{1, 2, 3\}$ denote project $i$'s outcome. The relationship between $y_i^\ast$ and $y_i$ is as follows:
\begin{align}
y_i = \begin{cases}
0 \text{ if } y_i^\ast < \mu_0 \\
1 \text{ if } \mu_0 \leq y_i^\ast < \mu_1 \\
2 \text{ if } \mu_1 \leq y_i^\ast
\end{cases}
\end{align}
with $\mu_0 < \mu_1$. The model is therefore an ordered logit model, and the outcomes are monotonic in $\mathbf{X}_i \beta$. The parameters $\beta$, $\mu_0$, and $\mu_1$ are estimated by maximum likelihood.
